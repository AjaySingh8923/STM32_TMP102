# STM32F4xx HAL Driver

## Overview
This repository contains the STM32F4xx Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) module driver. The HAL provides a set of generic and common APIs that can be used by peripheral drivers and user applications to start using the STM32F4xx microcontroller.

The HAL driver includes functionalities for initializing the system, managing peripherals, handling low-level hardware initialization, time base configuration, and providing essential control functions for STM32F4xx-based applications.

## Features
- Initialization and de-initialization of the HAL library.
- Configuration of time base using SysTick.
- Support for various HAL control functions like HAL_GetTick, HAL_Delay, and more.
- Device revision and unique ID retrieval.
- Debug module control during various low-power modes.
- Flash memory management, including bank swapping support for specific STM32F4xx models.

## Versioning
STM32F4xx HAL Driver Version: 1.8.3

| Field          | Value     |
|----------------|-----------|
| Main Version   | 0x01      |
| Sub1 Version   | 0x08      |
| Sub2 Version   | 0x03      |
| Release Type   | RC (Release Candidate) |

## How to Use This Driver

### Initialization
To use the HAL driver, the `HAL_Init` function must be called first. This will:
- Configure the Flash prefetch, instruction, and data caches.
- Set the NVIC priority grouping.
- Configure the SysTick timer to generate a 1ms time base interrupt.
- Call the `HAL_MspInit` callback for low-level hardware initialization.

Example:
```c
#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"

int main(void)
{
    // Initialize HAL library
    HAL_Init();

    // Your application code here

    while (1)
    {
        // Main loop
    }
}
Tick Configuration
The HAL driver provides an API to configure the time base used by the HAL_Delay function. By default, SysTick is used, but you can configure it for other time sources if needed.

To configure the tick frequency, you can use:

c
Copy
HAL_SetTickFreq(HAL_TICK_FREQ_1KHZ); // Set tick frequency to 1kHz
Time Delay
You can use the HAL_Delay function to create a blocking delay in milliseconds. The delay is based on the configured tick frequency:

c
Copy
HAL_Delay(1000); // Delay for 1000 milliseconds
HAL Control Functions
The HAL driver also provides control functions for debugging, enabling/disabling the debug module during different low-power modes, and retrieving device identifiers.

Enable Debug in Sleep Mode:
c
Copy
HAL_DBGMCU_EnableDBGSleepMode();
Get Device Unique ID:
c
Copy
uint32_t uid0 = HAL_GetUIDw0();
uint32_t uid1 = HAL_GetUIDw1();
uint32_t uid2 = HAL_GetUIDw2();
File Structure
The project includes the following files:

stm32f4xx_hal.c: The main HAL driver implementation file.
stm32f4xx_hal.h: The header file with definitions and function prototypes for the HAL.
stm32f4xx_hal_msp.c: The file containing low-level hardware initialization and de-initialization (to be implemented by the user).
stm32f4xx_hal_msp.h: The header file for MSP functions.
Debugging and Flash Memory Control
The STM32F4 HAL driver supports advanced features like Flash memory bank swapping for specific STM32F4xx devices. For devices like STM32F427, STM32F429, STM32F469, etc., the following functions are available:

Enable Flash memory bank swapping:
c
Copy
HAL_EnableMemorySwappingBank();
Disable Flash memory bank swapping:
c
Copy
HAL_DisableMemorySwappingBank();
